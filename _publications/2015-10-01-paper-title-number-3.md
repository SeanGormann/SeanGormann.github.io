excerpt: 'Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a major cause of stroke and dementia. By studying a genetic form of CSVD caused by mutations in the collagen genes COL4A1 and COL4A2, researchers aim to find potential treatments for both genetic and common forms of the disease. These genes are crucial for blood vessel structure, but their exact roles are not well understood, and it’s unclear how their mutations lead to CSVD. Researchers used various methods to study mice with COL4A1 mutations, revealing several problems in blood vessel development and maintenance. They found issues such as abnormal growth patterns in the retinal blood vessels, irregularities in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and a loss of these cells with age. Importantly, they discovered that these mutations lead to increased activity of a protein called TGFβ, which contributes to the vascular problems. By reducing TGFβ activity in the mice, researchers were able to improve blood vessel structure and reduce brain hemorrhages. This suggests that targeting TGFβ could be a potential treatment strategy for CSVD, including its more common, non-genetic forms.'
