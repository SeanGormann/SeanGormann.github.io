title: "Deletion of the Unfolded Protein Response Transducer IRE1α Is Detrimental to Aging Photoreceptors and to ER Stress-Mediated Retinal Degeneration"

excerpt: 'The unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered when the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is overwhelmed and misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, a condition referred to as ER stress. IRE1α is an ER-resident protein that plays major roles in orchestrating the UPR. Several lines of evidence implicate the UPR and its transducers in neurodegenerative diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a group of inherited diseases that cause progressive dysfunction and loss of rod and cone photoreceptors. This study evaluated the contribution of IRE1α to photoreceptor development, homeostasis, and degeneration.'

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered when the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is overwhelmed and misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, a condition referred to as ER stress. IRE1α is an ER-resident protein that plays major roles in orchestrating the UPR. Several lines of evidence implicate the UPR and its transducers in neurodegenerative diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a group of inherited diseases that cause progressive dysfunction and loss of rod and cone photoreceptors. This study evaluated the contribution of IRE1α to photoreceptor development, homeostasis, and degeneration.
