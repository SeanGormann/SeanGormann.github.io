title: " The UPR transducer—IRE1α—is required for photoreceptor health and protection against retinal degeneration."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: ' Several lines of evidence implicate the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and its transducers in neurodegenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa. ER stress triggers an intracellular signaling pathway called the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). IRE1α is an ER resident protein that plays a major role in orchestrating the UPR. Here we aim to assess the contribution of IRE1α to photoreceptor homeostasis and retinal degeneration.'
