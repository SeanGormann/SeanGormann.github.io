excerpt: ' Several lines of evidence implicate the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and its transducers in neurodegenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa. ER stress triggers an intracellular signaling pathway called the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). IRE1α is an ER resident protein that plays a major role in orchestrating the UPR.

# Abstract
### Purpose
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered when the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is overwhelmed and misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, a condition referred to as ER stress. IRE1α is an ER-resident protein that plays major roles in orchestrating the UPR. Several lines of evidence implicate the UPR and its transducers in neurodegenerative diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a group of inherited diseases that cause progressive dysfunction and loss of rod and cone photoreceptors. This study evaluated the contribution of IRE1α to photoreceptor development, homeostasis, and degeneration.

### Methods
We used a conditional gene targeting strategy to selectively inactivate Ire1α in mouse rod photoreceptors. We used a combination of optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, histology, and electroretinography (ERG) to assess longitudinally the effect of IRE1α deficiency in retinal development and function. Furthermore, we evaluated the IRE1α-deficient retina responses to tunicamycin-induced ER stress and in the context of RP caused by the rhodopsin mutation RhoP23H.

### Results
OCT imaging, histology, and ERG analyses did not reveal abnormalities in IRE1α-deficient retinas up to 3 months old. However, by 6 months of age, the Ire1α mutant animals showed reduced outer nuclear layer thickness and deficits in retinal function. Furthermore, conditional inactivation of Ire1α in rod photoreceptors accelerated retinal degeneration caused by the RhoP23H mutation.

### Conclusions
These data suggest that IRE1α is dispensable for photoreceptor development but important for photoreceptor homeostasis in aging retinas and for protecting against ER stress-mediated photoreceptor degeneration.
