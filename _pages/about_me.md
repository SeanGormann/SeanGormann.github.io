## Career

I began my career in molecular biology, working as a Junior Research Specialist at the University of California, San Francisco's Gould Lab from 2019 to 2022. During my time there, I worked in a multidisciplinary lab studying the mechanisms underpinning the disease ‘Gould Syndrome’. I spearheaded the technical work of two projects relating to kidney dysfunction and creating/analyzing KO cell lines. Additionally, I trained new staff research associates and junior specialists in techniques such as genotyping, DNA sequence analysis, western blots, immunolabelling, cell culture, MEF harvesting, and CRISPR-Cas9 transfection.

Since then, I have transitioned into the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, where I am currently a Machine Learning Researcher at the University of Lisbon. Here, I apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to drug discovery, predicting pharmacological metrics such as Ki and IC50. I automate the extraction, transformation, and visualization of datasets with over half a million samples, and design and test deep learning architectures including Transformers and Graph Neural Networks. My work involves the generation of code, training with cloud computing platforms like GCP, AWS, and Vast AI, result analysis, and model optimization.

As an AI Engineer Consultant, I assist companies in integrating AI into their workflow and implementing advanced data processing with large language models (LLMs). I have accumulated data through web-scraping and processed it using AI, delivering customized databases tailored to each company's use case. My projects include developing custom models to simulate biological systems and implementing AI solutions to enhance business operations.
